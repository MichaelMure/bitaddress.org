How to Use Safely:
 
- Step 0. Follow the security checklist recommendation.
First step is to download this website from Github and open the index.html file directly from your computer. For extra security, unplug your Internet access while generating your wallet. 

- Step 1. Generate new address
Choose your currency and click on the "Generate new address" button. 

- Step 2. Print the Paper Wallet
Click the Paper Wallet tab and print the page on high quality setting. Never save the page as a PDF file to print it later since a file is more likely to be hacked than a piece of paper. 

- Step 3. Fold the Paper Wallet
Fold your new Paper wallet following the lines. 
You can insert one side inside the other to lock the wallet. 

- Step 4. Share your public address
Use your public address to receive money from other crypto-currency users. You can share your public address as much as you want. 

- Step 5. Keep your private key secret
The private key is literally the keys to your coins, if someone was to obtain it, they could withdraw the funds currently in the wallet, and any funds that might be deposited in that wallet. 
Please test spending a small amount before receiving any large payments.
